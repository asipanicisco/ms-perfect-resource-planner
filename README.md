- **Visual indicators**: Color-coded status (Available, Fully Occupied, Over-allocated)
- **Detailed breakdowns**: Monthly availability and allocation percentages in pivot tables
- **85% threshold**: Engineers are considered fully occupied at 85% allocation

### ðŸš€ Future Projects Planning

bashstreamlit run resource_allocation_app.py

Access the application
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8501

Application Workflow
Getting Started

Add Engineers: Use the "âž• Quick Add Engineer" form to add team members
Set PTO: Navigate to "Monthly PTO Management" tab to set time off
Create Assignments: Add monthly assignments with allocation percentages
Review Utilization: Check the Engineer Utilization Summary for availability

Key Concepts

Allocation %: Percentage of an engineer's time allocated to a feature
Effective Allocation: Allocation adjusted for PTO days
Working Days: Standard 22 working days per month minus PTO
Availability Threshold: 85% - engineers are considered fully occupied above this

Tips for Best Use

Name Consistency: Ensure engineer names match exactly between sections
PTO Entry: Enter PTO before creating assignments for accurate calculations
Fix PTO Button: Use if utilization isn't calculating correctly
Refresh Button: Force reload data if updates aren't showing

Data Storage
The application uses CSV files for data persistence:

engineers.csv: Engineer roster and PTO data
monthly_assignments.csv: Feature assignments by month
future_projects.csv: Future project planning data

Troubleshooting
Utilization showing 100% availability despite assignments

Click the "ðŸ”§ Fix PTO" button to ensure PTO columns exist for assignment months
Check that engineer names match exactly (no extra spaces)
Use the "ðŸ”„ Refresh" button to reload data

Data not saving

The application auto-saves on most actions
Use the manual "ðŸ’¾ Save" buttons as backup
Check file permissions in the application directory

Adding rows causes data loss

Use the "âž• Quick Add Engineer" form instead of inline table editing
This is a known Streamlit limitation with dynamic row addition

Color Coding
Availability Colors

ðŸŸ¢ Green: Good availability (>20%)
ðŸŸ¡ Yellow: Low availability (1-20%)
ðŸ”´ Red: No availability (0%)

Status Indicators

Available: Under 85% allocation
Fully Occupied: 85-100% allocation
Over-allocated: Above 100% allocation

Known Limitations

Dynamic row editing: Adding rows directly in tables may cause issues
Browser storage: localStorage/sessionStorage not supported in artifacts
Excel formulas: Export includes data only, no formulas
